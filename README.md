# Forier Series visualization
This progam is a visualization of the forier series and its implementation in the summation of sinusoids into shapes.

# To run
Make sure a recent version of java is installed, compile and run targetting the ForeirVisual class.

# Upon running 
The user will be prompted to draw a picture using the left mouse button. The drawing must be a single continuous line. To submit the drawing the user can press the right click.

Once submitted the program will find the sum of sinusoids that will create circles to draw and recreate your image. The image will be drawn over and over until the user draws another image.

# Processing
The visual tools used to draw to the screen were created by the Processing foundation.
